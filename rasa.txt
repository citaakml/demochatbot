Chapter 1: Intro
Exploring Rasa
Rasa has three major components that work together to create contextual assistants:
Note: As of Dec 2019, Rasa Core is now known as dialogue management, to more accurately 
desdribe its function. Together, the NLU and dialogue management libraries make up Rasa 
Open Source.
Rasa NLU
Rasa NLU is like the “ear” of your assistant—it helps your assistant understand what’s 
being said. Rasa NLU takes user input in the form of unstructured human language and 
extracts structured data in the form of intents and entities. 
● Intents are labels that represent the goal, or meaning, of a user’s specific input. 
For example, the message ‘Hello’ could have the label ‘greet’ because the 
meaning of this message is a greeting. 
● Entities are important keywords that an assistant should take note of. For 
example, the message ‘My name is Juste’ has the name ‘Juste’ in it. An assistant 
should extract the name and remember it throughout the conversation to keep the 
interaction natural. 
○ Entity extraction is achieved by training a named entity recognition model 
to identify and extract the entities (in this example, names) for 
unstructured user messages
Rasa Core
Core is Rasa’s dialogue management component. It decides how an assistant should 
respond based on 1) the state of the conversation and 2) the context. Rasa Core learns 
by observing patterns in conversational data between users and an assistant. 
Rasa X
Rasa X is a toolset for developers to build, improve and deploy contextual assistants with 
the Rasa framework. You can use Rasa X to:
- View and annotate conversations
- Get feedback from testers
- Version and manage models
With Rasa X, you can share your assistant with real users and collect the conversations 
they have with the assistant, allowing you to improve your assistant without interrupting 
the assistant running in production.
